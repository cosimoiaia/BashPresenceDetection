# Bash Presence Detection
Very simple&amp;small bash script to detect your presence in the house and control your devices.

When your presence is detected it will turn on your lights, music and screens. In the same way everything will be turned off when you leave the building.

It's based on your mobile phone network and the assumption that it will connect to your wi-fi when you are at home.

Usage:
Just run the script as a deamon.

Dependencies:
Install fping from official repository.
